# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.16] - 2026-05-11

## [0.1.15] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Release 0.1.15 (no notes — fill me in)

## [0.1.14] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Release 0.1.14 (no notes — fill me in)

## [0.1.13] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`scripts/update.sh` — lifecycle manager for the local install**. Pulls the latest `main`, rebuilds the `lgit` binary, re-registers the Claude Code MCP server, and prints a restart hint. Flags: `--no-pull` (build current tree), `--dry-run`, `--quiet`, `--force` (skip dirty-tree check), `--no-mcp`, `--no-restart-hint`. Runs from any subdirectory — `cd`s to repo root itself.
- **`make update` / `make update-local` / `make status`** — thin Makefile wrappers around `scripts/update.sh` plus a status target that prints the binary version, running `lgit` PIDs, and the Claude Code MCP registration state. No more guessing which `lgit` is wired up.
- **`scripts/release.sh` + `make release-patch|release-minor|release-major`** — one-command release flow: verifies clean tree on `main` up-to-date with `origin`, bumps `extension/package.json` and `extension/package-lock.json`, rotates the CHANGELOG `Unreleased` section to the new version with today's date, commits, creates an annotated tag, and pushes both — which triggers the `release.yml` workflow that publishes binaries and `.vsix`.

### Fixed

- **Extension version alignment**: `extension/package.json` and `extension/package-lock.json` were stuck at `0.1.11` and `0.1.6` respectively across every tag from `v0.1.7` onward. The published `.vsix` therefore reported a stale internal version regardless of the tag name. Both files are now in lock-step with the release tag, enforced by `scripts/release.sh`.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **Global `exclude_paths` in `.l0git.json`**: a top-level `exclude_paths` array now applies to every content-scanning gate without repeating the list under each `gate_options` entry. Gate-specific `exclude_paths` are still supported and are merged after the global ones. Example:

  ```json
  {
    "exclude_paths": ["**/generated/**", "vendor/**"],
    "gate_options": {
      "secrets_scan": { "exclude_paths": ["**/fixtures/**"] }
    }
  }
  ```

  The injection happens in `optionsFor` — zero changes to gate function signatures.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **`tests_present`**: added `.test.mjs` / `.test.cjs` / `.spec.mjs` / `.spec.cjs` (Vitest ESM/CJS), `*Test.cs` / `*Tests.cs` (C# / .NET), `*Test.php` / `*Tests.php` / `test*.php` (PHPUnit), `*Spec.kt` (Kotlin). Projects using these conventions no longer get a false-positive "No tests found" warning.
- **`connection_strings` / `db_uri`**: regex extended to cover `sqlserver://`, `mssql://` (SQL Server), `mariadb://`, `couchdb://`, `cassandra://`, `cql://`. Previously these connection string schemes passed through undetected.
- **`secrets_scan_history` cap transparency**: when history scanning stops at the `max_blobs` ceiling (default 5000) an `info` finding is now emitted — "History scan stopped after N blobs (M total) — oldest commits NOT scanned." Previously the truncation was completely silent, giving false confidence that the full history was clean.
- **VSCode extension / diagnostics truncation**: the hardcoded `-limit=500` in `syncDiagnostics` has been raised to 2000. If the cap is still reached a warning toast is shown ("diagnostics capped — run `lgit list` from the terminal for the full set"). Previously the Problems pane silently showed fewer findings than existed.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed (VSCode extension UI/UX — draconian round)

- **Loading indicator**: status bar now shows `$(loading~spin) l0-git: checking…` while gates are running, so the user always knows a scan is in progress instead of seeing a stale count.
- **Go-to-line navigation**: clicking a finding in the tree now opens the file AND positions the cursor at the exact line the gate flagged. Scan-style gates encode `<file>:<line>:<rule_id>` in `file_path`; the line component was parsed but previously ignored for navigation.
- **Binary path validation**: changing `l0-git.binaryPath` in settings now immediately checks whether the path exists on disk and shows a warning with an "Open settings" button if it doesn't — no more silent failures at run-time.
- **Clear project — finding count**: the "Delete all l0-git findings for …?" confirmation dialog now includes the finding count (e.g., "12 findings") so the user knows what they're about to delete.
- **MCP spawn safety**: `startMCP` validates binary existence before spawning, attaches an `error` event handler to catch ENOENT at spawn-time (prevents unhandled-rejection leaks on activation failure), and guards the `exit` callback against a stale reference when `stopMCP` replaces the process.
- **File watchers for late-joined folders**: adding a workspace folder after activation now registers the full set of file-change watchers for that folder, so the sidebar responds to README/LICENSE/compose/… changes in folders opened after startup.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`secrets_scan` known-non-secret filter** (`server/known_non_secrets.go`). A post-entropy layer eliminates false positives whose matched value is publicly known and carries zero information advantage for an attacker. Four tiers applied in order:
  - **Tier 1 — placeholder / template syntax**: `{{secret}}`, `${MY_KEY}`, `<TOKEN>`, `%SECRET%`, `[MY_TOKEN]`, `__VAR__`, `@VAR@`, `#{var}` and explicit instruction words (`changeme`, `replace_me`, `not_set`, `redacted`, `dummy`, `fake`, `mock`, …)
  - **Tier 2 — well-known service defaults** (~200 entries, each traceable to an official vendor page): PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ (`guest`), Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, MinIO (`minioadmin`), Grafana, Keycloak, SonarQube, Harbor (`Harbor12345`), GitLab legacy (`5iveL!fe`), Vault dev-server (`root`, `dev-root-token`), LocalStack, Kafka, Airflow, Superset, Metabase, n8n, Jenkins, Drone, Woodpecker, Portainer, Gitea, Azurite, JWT tutorial secrets, and ~100 more
  - **Tier 3 — official test / sandbox key prefixes**: `sk_test_` / `pk_test_` / `rk_test_` / `whsec_test_` (Stripe), `sandbox-sq0isp-` / `sandbox-sq0atb-` (Square), `test_sk_` / `test_pk_` (Checkout.com), `sandbox_` (Braintree), `adyentest_` (Adyen)
  - **Tier 4 — canonical documentation examples**: AWS `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` + secret key, Azurite well-known storage account key, jwt.io debugger token, GCP quickstart key, GitHub PAT examples, Slack token examples, Twilio test SIDs, SendGrid / npm / OpenAI / Anthropic / Stripe placeholder examples

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed (false-positive reduction — round 2, 5 gates)

- **`connection_strings`**: single-label hostnames (no dot) are now exempt from the `http_remote` rule — `http://kafka`, `http://redis`, `http://db-primary` are Docker/k8s internal service names that are never reachable on the public internet.
- **`css_lint` / `thin_font_weight`**: `selectorIsBodyText` now handles element selectors with class/pseudo-class modifiers (`body.dark-theme`, `p:not(.lead)`) and comma-separated lists (`html, body { … }`); the `"html, body"` dead case in the switch was removed.
- **`css_lint` / `justified_text`**: `@media print { … }` blocks are exempt — justified text is standard typographic practice in print stylesheets where hyphenation is controlled by the renderer.
- **`compose_lint`**: orchestrator image list extended with `nginx`, `jwilder/nginx-proxy`, `nginxproxy/nginx-proxy`, `haproxy`, `envoyproxy/envoy`, `caddy`, `prom/prometheus`, `grafana/grafana`, `grafana/loki`, `grafana/promtail`, `prom/alertmanager`, `prom/node-exporter`, and more; new gate option `additional_orchestrator_images` lets projects add custom entries without an inline override per service.
- **`vendored_dir_tracked`**: `vendor/` is now exempt in Ruby projects that have `Gemfile` + `vendor/bundle/` (Bundler `--deployment` / `--path vendor/bundle` idiom for hermetic builds).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed (false-positive reduction — 14 gates)

- **`nvmrc_missing`**: silent when `package.json` declares `engines.node` or `volta.node`; plain `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` files remain the canonical signal.
- **`vendored_dir_tracked`**: `vendor/` is no longer flagged in Go projects that have `vendor/modules.txt` (idiomatic `-mod=vendor`); same exemption for PHP Composer (`vendor/autoload.php`).
- **`secrets_scan` / `secrets_scan_history`**: added Shannon entropy floor (≥ 3.5 bits/char) on all variable-body patterns — mock data, placeholder strings, and doc examples that happen to match the regex are skipped. `skip_default_fixture_paths` now **defaults to `true`** (was `false`); set it to `false` explicitly to scan test fixtures.
- **`network_scan`**: `docNets` extended with RFC 2544 benchmarking range (`198.18.0.0/15`), IANA MCAST-TEST-NET (`233.252.0.0/24`), and RFC 6598 CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`) — these no longer produce a warning.
- **`connection_strings`**: `http://` URLs to standard-body hosts (`w3.org`, `ietf.org`, `xmlsoap.org`, `schemas.microsoft.com`, `purl.org`, `oasis-open.org`, …) are now exempt — XML namespaces and RFC references in source files no longer fire.
- **`compose_lint`**: `docker_socket_mount` is demoted to `info` for well-known orchestrator/proxy images (Traefik, Portainer, Watchtower, Dozzle, cAdvisor, …). An inline `# l0git: ignore docker_socket_mount` silences both the warning and the info variant.
- **`markdown_lint`**: `codeblock_invalid_payload` no longer fires for `jsonc`, `json5`, `hjson`, `json with comments` (pass-through — stdlib parser rejects their legal syntax). `ndjson` / `jsonl` are validated line-by-line.
- **`unexpected_executable_bit`**: files under `bin/`, `scripts/`, `script/`, `tools/`, `tool/`, `cmd/`, `hack/`, `.bin/` are exempted — intentional executable wrappers in conventional locations no longer flag.
- **`version_drift`**: root `package.json` is excluded from cross-manifest comparison when monorepo markers are present (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json`, `nx.json`, `turbo.json`, or `workspaces` field).
- **`tests_present`**: added `cypress/`, `playwright/`, `e2e/`, `integration/`, `features/` (Cucumber) to recognized test directory names; added fallback that checks `package.json` devDependencies for well-known test runners (Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright, Mocha, …).
- **`css_lint`**: `hidden_scrollbar` severity demoted from `warning` to `info` — the gate cannot determine cross-selector whether the element is actually scrollable, so a hard warning was disproportionate.
- **`dead_placeholders`**: files whose basename is a placeholder tracking register (`TODO.md`, `FIXME.md`, `TODO.txt`, `TODO`, …) are now skipped entirely.
- **`.l0git.json`**: removed now-redundant `skip_default_fixture_paths: true` entries (the default is `true`).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Remediation recipes.** New `lgit fix <id>` CLI prints a structured
  fix for any finding: summary, exact shell commands, file edits with
  caveats, a verification step, and a Claude-Code-ready prompt block.
  `--json` emits the same payload as `Remediation { summary, confidence,
  recipe?, claude_prompt }` for tooling. Never executes — print only.
  Eight gates ship deterministic recipes today (`vendored_dir_tracked`,
  `ide_artifact_tracked`, `gitignore_coverage`,
  `unexpected_executable_bit`, `env_example_uncommented`,
  `merge_conflict_markers`, `large_blob_in_history`,
  `secrets_scan_history`); the rest fall back to `confidence: guided`
  with only the prompt populated.
- **`findings_remediate` MCP tool.** Same payload as `lgit fix --json`,
  callable from Claude Code. Pairs with the agent's own Bash/Edit tools
  so HITL is preserved at the apply step.
- **Sidebar inline actions.** Every finding row now has "Show fix
  recipe" (opens `lgit fix <id>` output in a doc) and "Ask Claude Code
  to fix" (copies the prompt to the clipboard) next to the existing
  ignore / delete buttons.

### Changed

- **Sidebar defaults rebalanced for signal-to-noise.** New installs hide
  `info`-severity findings by default — toggle via the severity filter to
  bring them back. `override_accepted` is now suppressed from the tree at
  every severity level (still persisted, still surfaced in the dashboard
  and `lgit list -gate=override_accepted`). Toasts fire for `error` only;
  warnings and info live in the sidebar / Problems pane. Existing users
  with customised filters keep them.
- Sidebar empty state now distinguishes "no actionable findings, N info
  hidden" from "no findings at all" so a clean tree no longer disguises
  pending audit work.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- `TestUnexpectedExecutableBit_FlagsTextFiles` failed on the Windows
  CI runner because `os.Chmod(0o755)` is a no-op on Windows
  filesystems and git can't pick up an executable bit the filesystem
  doesn't carry. The test helper now drives the mode via
  `git update-index --chmod=+x`, which works portably across the
  Linux / macOS / Windows matrix.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- `scanOptions.skip_default_fixture_paths` — opt-in flag (default
  `false`) on every content-scan gate. When enabled, files matching
  `*_test.go` / `test_*.py` / `*_test.py` / `*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` /
  `*.spec.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` / `*_test.rs` / `*Test.{java,kt}` /
  `*_spec.rb` / `conftest.py`, plus paths traversing
  `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `testdata/`, `fixtures/`,
  `__fixtures__/` are skipped. Removes the dogfood noise where test
  fixtures legitimately contain trigger material (mock secrets,
  fake URLs, fake IPs).

### Changed

- Overview dashboard: TAGS card explicitly explains that a finding
  contributes to every tag it carries (counts can sum to more than
  the open total).
- Sparkline shows a "trend will fill in over the next 7 days" hint
  when ≤ 1 day has data — typical of fresh databases.
- `.l0git.json` of l0-git itself now enables
  `skip_default_fixture_paths` for the 8 content-scan gates, dropping
  self-flagged fixtures from 79 → 40 findings.

### Fixed

- "By severity (open)" percentages used `s.total` (across all
  statuses) as denominator, so values summed to less than 100% when
  resolved/ignored findings existed. Now relative to the open total
  (`sum(by_severity)`), so percentages always close to 100%.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- `branch_protection_declared` gate (severity `info`, opt-in via
  `gate_options.branch_protection_declared.enabled = true`). Verifies
  the project tracks branch-protection rules as code via Probot Settings
  (`.github/settings.yml` with `branches: [{protection: …}]`). Cannot
  see the actual server-side state — that needs a network call with
  auth, which is out of scope. Companion CodeAction quick-fix scaffolds
  a `.github/settings.yml` with sensible defaults (PR review required,
  no force-push, no deletions).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added — gates (33 total, was 9)

**Project hygiene** — `code_of_conduct_present`, `codeowners_present` (silent
on docs-only repos via language-extension heuristic).

**Quality / release hygiene** — `tests_present` (multi-language test
detection: Go / Python / TS-JSX / Rust / Java / Kotlin / Ruby), `version_drift`
(cross-checks `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `mix.exs`,
`pom.xml`, `VERSION`), `nvmrc_missing`.

**Git hygiene** — `merge_conflict_markers` (line-precise, byte-pattern),
`large_file_tracked` (LFS-aware via `.gitattributes`), `unexpected_executable_bit`
(filters by extension whitelist of "definitely-not-script"), `vendored_dir_tracked`
(one finding per top-level dir), `ide_artifact_tracked` (`.vscode`/`.idea`/
`.DS_Store`/swap files), `filename_quality` (spaces / control / non-ASCII),
`gitignore_coverage` (stack-aware: `package.json` → `node_modules`, `Cargo.toml`
→ `target`, `pyproject.toml` → `__pycache__`+`.venv`, etc.).

**Security** — `secrets_scan` (10 high-precision patterns + `.env` tracked
detection, scoped to `git ls-files`), `connection_strings` (URI-style
detection: credentials inline → `error`; ftp/telnet/smb/nfs/rsync →
`warning`; cleartext `http://` non-local + `ldap://` + DB URIs → `info`),
`network_scan` (IPv4/CIDR/ASN classification: public → `warning`,
private/loopback/RFC-doc → `info`).

**Containers** — `dockerfile_lint` (hand-rolled AST: `from_untagged`,
`from_latest`, `add_instruction`, `missing_user`, `user_root`),
`compose_lint` (`yaml.v3` AST: `yaml_invalid`, `privileged_true`,
`network_mode_host`, `docker_socket_mount`, `missing_memory_limit`).

**Frontend / accessibility** — `html_lint` (`golang.org/x/net/html`
tokenizer with per-line tracking: viewport-blocks-zoom, autoplay-without-muted,
target-`_blank`-without-rel, mystery-meat-nav, placeholder-as-label,
reset-button), `css_lint` (hand-rolled: hidden-scrollbar, thin-font-weight
on body-text, justified-text).

**Documentation** — `markdown_lint` (goldmark AST: `image_no_alt`,
`link_local_broken`, `link_anchor_broken` with GitHub-style slug,
`codeblock_no_language`, `codeblock_invalid_payload` for ` ```json ` /
` ```yaml ` blocks), `dead_placeholders` (TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK/Lorem ipsum
across tracked text files), `env_example_uncommented` (each `KEY=` line
must have an inline or preceding `#` comment).

**History scanning (opt-in)** — `secrets_scan_history` and
`large_blob_in_history` walk every blob reachable from any ref via
`git rev-list --all --objects` + `git cat-file --batch-check`. Both opt-in
via `gate_options.<gate>.enabled = true` because the walk is slow on big
repos. Findings carry `history:<sha>:…` paths and remediation messages
point at `git filter-repo`.

### Added — extension UI

**Tier 1 (in-tree controls)** — group findings by severity / gate / file /
tag / status / none; sort by updated / created / severity / gate / file;
status filter (open / ignored / resolved / all); per-severity multi-select
toggle; substring search across title/message/file/gate. State persists in
`globalState` across sessions; active state surfaces in `treeView.description`
("12 findings · group: severity · sort: severity · status: open").

**Tier 2 (Overview dashboard)** — webview with severity bars (open-only),
top gates, top files, tag chips (click to filter the tree), 7-day trend
sparkline. Backed by a new `findings_stats` MCP tool / `lgit stats` CLI
that returns aggregations in one round trip. Auto-refreshes after every
`runChecksAndRefresh`.

**CodeAction quick-fixes** — lightbulb action on every finding for a
fixable presence-style gate. LICENSE picker offers MIT / Apache-2.0 /
BSD-3-Clause / GPL-3.0 / MPL-2.0 / Unlicense; other gates write a
canonical scaffold and re-run gates so the diagnostic clears.

**Inline override directive** — `# l0git: ignore <rule_id> reason: …`
(plus YAML / Markdown / HTML / CSS comment variants) silences a single
rule on a single line. Override emits an `override_accepted` info
finding for audit. Missing `reason: …` bumps it to `warning`.

**Status bar item** — bottom-left, severity-aware: `$(check) l0-git: clean`
or `$(error|warning|info) l0-git: N` with tooltip breakdown. Clicks focus
the tree view.

**Diagnostics integration** — every open finding becomes a
`vscode.Diagnostic` keyed by `(file, line)` with `source = l0-git` and
`code = gate_id`. Showed in the Problems pane and on file-gutter icons.

**File watchers extended** — ~30 patterns covering README/LICENSE/CHANGELOG,
`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.nvmrc`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT*`,
`.env.example*`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*.yml`, manifests
(`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `mix.exs`, `pom.xml`),
`.github/**`. Adding/editing any input file re-runs gates without manual
refresh.

**Blame annotation** — opt-in via `l0-git.showBlame: true`. After each
fetch, runs `git blame --line-porcelain` per affected file (in parallel)
and appends `<short-sha> · <author> · <relative-time>` to each row's
description and tooltip.

### Added — backend API

**Rich `findings_list`** — both CLI (`lgit list -project=…
-severity=…  -gate=… -tag=… -query=… -sort=… -limit=N -offset=N`) and
MCP (`findings_list { … }`) accept the same filter set. Tag matching is
CSV-aware: `git` does NOT match `git-hygiene`. Sort whitelist:
`updated` / `created` / `severity` (worst-first) / `gate` / `file`.

**`findings_stats`** — new MCP tool / `lgit stats` CLI returning the
aggregate the Overview webview needs in one trip. `by_severity` is
open-only for consistency with the rest of the dashboard; `by_status`
spans every row.

**`gateRegistryMarshallable`** — fixes a long-standing bug where
`lgit gates` and the `gates_list` MCP tool tried to JSON-encode `Gate`
values directly, failing because `Check` is a `func`. The endpoints
now serialise descriptive metadata only (id, title, description,
severity, tags).

**`Tags` field on findings** — gates declare a comma-separated tag set
(`security`, `git-hygiene`, `accessibility`, …) propagated to every
finding they emit. Stored in a new `findings.tags` column with auto-
migration via `PRAGMA table_info` + `ALTER TABLE`.

**Severity precedence rework** — finding severity is now
`config_override > gate_set > gate_default`, so tiered scanners
(`secrets_scan`, `connection_strings`, `network_scan`) keep their per-
match severities unless the user explicitly overrides at the gate
level via `.l0git.json`.

**`gate_options` map in `.l0git.json`** — typed, gate-specific JSON
sub-tree passed to each gate's `Check` function. Schemas include
`disabled_rules`, `disabled_patterns`, `exclude_paths`, `threshold_mb`,
`suggest_when_missing`, `enabled` (history gates).

### Changed

- SQLite store: `busy_timeout` raised from 5 s to 15 s to absorb
  cross-process WAL contention (extension + Claude-Code MCP server).
  Migration runs on every open via `PRAGMA table_info` to add the new
  `tags` column on legacy DBs without rewriting the schema.
- `lgit list` switched from positional args to flag-based for the rich
  filter set. The extension and tests are the only consumers.
- `lgit gates` and MCP `gates_list` now return JSON-safe metadata
  (`gateRegistryMarshallable`) instead of the runtime `Gate` struct.

### Fixed

- Watcher serialisation: `lgitQueue` Promise chain ensures the
  extension never spawns two `lgit` processes against the same SQLite
  DB at once. `runChecksAndRefresh` debounces watcher bursts so a
  multi-file save collapses to a single check pass.
- Overview `By severity` panel previously mixed open + resolved
  counts, contradicting the (open-only) tree below it. Now both are
  open-only; the dashboard explicitly labels the "Total (all statuses)"
  card.
- Webview button label rendered literally as `$(play) Run all checks`
  (codicon syntax isn't expanded inside webview HTML). Replaced with
  a Unicode play arrow.
- `mustWrite` test helper now `os.MkdirAll`s parent dirs so subpath
  fixtures like `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` no longer fail before
  the assertion runs.

### Documentation

- README rewritten to document all 33 gates (grouped by theme), the
  `.l0git.json` schema with `gate_options`, the inline override
  directive, the Tier 1 view controls, the Overview dashboard, the
  history-aware gates, the blame annotation setting, the 7 MCP tools,
  and the flag-based CLI.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

- Initial public commit: Go MCP stdio server + SQLite findings store +
  VSCode TreeView UI + first gate (`readme_present`).
